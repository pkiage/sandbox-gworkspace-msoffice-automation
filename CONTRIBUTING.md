# Code Guidelines

## JavaScript (Apps Script)
- Include Apache 2.0 license header in each file
- Use clear, functional naming (gdrive-create_folders.js)
- Keep script functions modular for easy reuse

## Python (Colab)
- Ensure notebooks run from top to bottom
- Add brief documentation in markdown cells or within code blocks
- Use relative paths or Google Drive mounts, not local-only paths

## VBA (.bas)
- Add comments for each function/sub
- Use descriptive module names
- Keep related routines grouped logically

## Pull request process
1. Open an issue first if it's a major change.
2. Add clear commit messages.
